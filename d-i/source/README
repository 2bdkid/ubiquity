These repositories are managed with subtree (with full history).

= How it was created ? =

salsa d-i git repos are mirrored to launchpad.net/$project

those repositories got forked as lp:~ubuntu-installer/$project at the
tag of the common base revision (i.e. 101ubuntu3, got forked at debian
tag 101).

then current ubuntu delta got applied, as a single commit on top of that.

then all those ubuntu-delta repositories got merged with subtree
command as seen in `subtree-cmds.sh`.

this means full history of d-i components is available, which is
shared with debian, and one can merge/rebase/pull/push from salsa
and/or lp:~ubuntu-installer/$project repositories. At least in theory.

Caveats

* some projects are ubuntu-only, i.e. partman-auto-loop thus I
  imported them with whatever I could find.
* some projects have no delta, so i simply pulled
  launchpad.net/$project ubuntu mirror.

* some projects still ships .deb and thus need to be uplaoded into
  Ubuntu archive normally. For those, I pulled from read-only UDD
  lp:ubuntu/+source/$package. Continue to upload those into the
  Archive, and then pull from the UDD branch. I.e. user-setup,
  console-setup, localechooser

= How to make an upload ? =

As before, it should just work:

```
./debian/rules update
debuild -- clean
debuild -S
```
